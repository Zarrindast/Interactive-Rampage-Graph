General Procedure...
- scraped everything from Langman, all original docs of all shooters
- converted the pdfs to txt with:
- attempted OCR on the files that didn't make it to txt well, using pytesseract
- used voice transcription for things that failed OCR (later: teach OCR how to read individual handwritings)
- went back and checked manually that each relevant document had made it to txt somehow
- search for desired terms, names, etc
- made a list of external name references (shooters who were not in this list)
- added school shooters to the list and tracked down files of them (forums)
- enumerated known copycats (via encyclopedia dramatica, perhaps searching "copycats" on other forums) and gave them links to their forefathers
